This project focuses on the classification of brain tumors using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and the Inception model and compare between them. The goal is to accurately distinguish between different types of brain tumors using MRI images.
# Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of MRI images of brain tumors. The dataset is divided into training and validation sets. Each image is labeled according to the type of brain tumor it represents.
